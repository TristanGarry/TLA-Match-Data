# TLA-Match-Data
Approach for pulling and organising Challonge match data using the Challonge API

### Contents

---

#### Base data

*generate_base_data.py* can be used to pull data from Challonge and generate some labelled data. 
Tournament list to be pulled can be modified using the `PATTERNS` variable for dynamic generation and `tournament_names` for more specific tournament names. Does not include character data. Requires a Challonge API key to be set up in a .env file. 

*matches.csv* generated by *generate_base_data.py*. It includes date, tournament, round, player_1, player_2, score (player_1-player_2)

*unique_players.csv* is generated by *generate_base_data.py*. It could be used to assign mains to each unique player to be merged into *matches.csv* to get character matchup numbers.

#### Patch info

*get_patch_dates.py* gets patch names and dates

*tough_love_arena_patches.csv* is generated by *get_patch_dates.py* and includes date and patch version

#### Elo & Glicko rating

*generate_ratings.py* takes the match data generated above and estimates some Elo and Glicko2 scores

*elo_ratings_plot.png* Shows the progression of the players with the top 8 Elo ratings as of the latest data dump
